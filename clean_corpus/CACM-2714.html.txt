Merging with Parallel Processors Consider two linearly ordered sets A B Am Bn mn and p pm parallel processors working synchronously The paper presents an algorithm for merging A and B with the p parallel processors which requires at most 2log2 2m13mp  mplog2 nm steps If n  2Bm B an integer the algorithm requires at most 2log2 m1  mp2B steps In the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude ie nkm with k being a constant the algorithm requires 2log2 m1  mp3k steps These performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm Batchers algorithm which requires np  mn2plog2 m steps in the general case and kmp  k12mplog2 m in the special case where nkm CACM October 1975 Gavril F parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion 531 CA751005 JB January 6 1978 1050 AM 2714 4 2714 3075 4 2714 2664 5 2714 2714 5 2714 2714 5 2714 2714 5 2714 3075 5 2714 2289 6 2714 2557 6 2714 2664 6 2714 2714 6 2714
