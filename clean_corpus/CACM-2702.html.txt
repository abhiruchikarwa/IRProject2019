On the Complexity of LRk Testing The problem of determining whether an arbitrary context-free grammar is a member of some easily parsed subclass of grammars such as the LRk grammars is considered The time complexity of this problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed integer and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test In the first case it is shown that for every k there exists an Onk2 algorithm for testing the LRk property where n is the size of the grammar in question On the other hand if both k and the subject grammar are problem parameters then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for k More specifically it is shown that this problem is NP-complete when k is expressed in unary When k is expressed in binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic exponential time These results carry over to many other parameterized classes of grammars such as the LLk strong LLk SLRk LCk and strong LCk grammars CACM December 1975 Hunt H B III Szymanski T G Ullman J D computational complexity context-free grammars parsing LRk grammars NP-complete problems 412 523 525 CA751205 JB January 5 1978 428 PM 2702 5 2702 2702 5 2702 2702 5 2702
