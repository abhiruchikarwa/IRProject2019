Notes on Recursion Elimination Various methods of recursion elimination are applied to the schematic recursive procedure proc Sx px then Nx Sfx Sgx Mx fi Procedures with this general form arise in connection with tree traversal and sorting algorithms Each method of recursion removal involves the use of one or more stacks and the solutions are compared on the basis of their running time CACM June 1977 Bird R S recursion elimination optimization of programs stacks trees sorting algorithms computational induction 40 42 520 524 525 531 CA770610 JB December 28 1977 1250 PM 2953 5 2953 2953 5 2953 2953 5 2953 3020 5 2953 2953 6 2953
