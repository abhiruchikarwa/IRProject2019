A Fast Algorithm for Computing Longest Common Subsequences Previously published algorithms for finding the longest common subsequence of two sequences of length n have had a best-case running time of On2 An algorithm for this problem is presented which has a running time of Or  nlog n where r is the total number of ordered pairs of positions at which the two sequences match Thus in the worst case the algorithm has a running time of On2 log n However for those applications where most positions of one sequence match relatively few positions in the other sequence a running time of On log n can be expected CACM May 1977 Hunt J W Szymanski T G Longest common subsequence efficient algorithms 373 363 525 CA770509 JB December 29 1977 146 AM 2963 4 2963 3114 4 2963 2745 5 2963 2963 5 2963 2963 5 2963 2963 5 2963
