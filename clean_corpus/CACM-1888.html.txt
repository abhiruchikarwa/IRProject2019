Spline Function Methods for Nonlinear Boundary-Value Problems The solution of the nonlinear differential equation YFxYY with two-point boundary conditions is approximated by a quintic or cubic spline function yx The method is well suited to nonuniform mesh size and dynamic mesh size allocation For uniform mesh size h the error in the quintic spline yx is Oh4 with typical error one-third that from Numerovs method Requiring the differential equation to be satisfied at the mesh points results in a set of difference equations which are block tridiagonal and so are easily solved by relaxation or other standard methods CACM June 1969 Blue J L boundary value problems differential equations finite differences functional approximation iterative methods nonlinear equations spline functions 513 515 517 CA690605 JB February 17 1978 1107 AM 1888 5 1888 1888 5 1888 1888 5 1888
