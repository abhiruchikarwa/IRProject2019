Symbolic Integration The Stormy Decade Three approaches to symbolic integration in the 1960s are described The first from artificial intelligence led to Slagles SAINT and to a large degree to Moses SIN The second from algebraic manipulation led to Manoves implementation and to Horowitz and Tobeys reexamination of the Hermite algorithm for integrating rational functions The third from mathematics led to Richardsons proof of the unsolvability of the problem for a class of functions and for Rischs decision procedure for the elementary functionseneralizations of Rischs algorithm to a class of special functions and programs for solving differential equations and for finding the definite integral are also described CACM August 1971 Moses J integration symbolic integration definite integrals rational functions 31 32 36 49 52 59 CA710808 JB February 2 1978 248 PM 2164 4 2164 2170 4 2164 2323 4 2164 2719 4 2164 2167 5 2164 2164 5 2164 2164 5 2164 2164 5 2164 2323 5 2164 2164 6 2164 2167 6 2164 2170 6 2164
