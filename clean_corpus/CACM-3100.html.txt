An Interference Matching Technique for Inducing Abstractions A method for inducing knowledge by abstraction from a sequence of training examples is described The proposed method interference matching induces abstractions by finding relational properties common to two or more exemplars Three tasks solved by a program that uses an interference-matching algorithm are presented Several problems concerning the description of the training examples and the adequacy of interference matching are discussed and directions for future research are considered CACM May 1978 Hayes-Roth F McDermott J Rule induction knowledge acquisition partial matching interference graph matching learning induction knowledge representation informal retrieval abstraction generalization language learning complexity predicate discovery 336 361 362 366 370 532 CA780507 DH February 26 1979 126 PM 3100 5 3100 3100 5 3100 3100 5 3100
