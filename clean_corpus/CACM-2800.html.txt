Connections Between Accuracy and Stability Properties of Linear Multistep Formulas This paper is concerned with stability and accuracy of families of linear k-step formulas depending on parameters with particular emphasis on the numerical solution of stiff ordinary differential equations An upper bound pk is derived for the order of accuracy of Ainf-stable formulas Three criteria are given for A0-stability It is shown that 1 for pk k arbitrary Ainf-stability implies certain necessary conditions for A0-stability and for strict stability meaning that the extraneous roots of ppsi satisfy psi1 2 for pk234and 5 Ainf-stability for k5 together with another constraint implies strict stability and 3 for certain one-parameter classes of formulas with pk34andor 5 Ainf-stability implies A0-stability CACM January 1975 Liniger W stiff equations parametrized linear multistep formulas order of accuracy A0-stability Ainf-stability strict stability 517 CA750111 JB January 12 1978 926 AM 2800 5 2800 2800 5 2800 2800 5 2800
