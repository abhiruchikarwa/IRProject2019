A Processor Allocation Method for Time-Sharing A scheduling algorithm is proposed which is intended to minimize changes of tasks on processors and thereby reduce over-head The algorithm also has application to more general resource allocation problems It is implemented by means of a method for efficiently handling dynamically changing segmented lists CACM January 1970 Mullery A P Driscoll G C time sharing resource allocation scheduling algorithms monitors dynamic allocation processor allocation multiprogramming multiprocessing time slicing scheduling conversational systems interactive systems 380 430 431 432 633 CA700103 JB February 14 1978 215 PM 1751 4 2128 1892 4 2128 2128 4 2128 2218 4 2128 1752 5 2128 2128 5 2128 2128 5 2128 2128 5 2128
