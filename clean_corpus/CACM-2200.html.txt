On Complement Division The division algorithm theorem is expressed in a form that permits it to serve as the basis for devising division operations that produce both quotient and remainder in complement form Algorithms for division yielding complement results are derived for numbers represented in any base greater than one Both radix and radix-less-one complementation schemes are considered The binary form of the algorithms thus includes both twos and ones complement implementation The problem of quotient overflow for complement results is dealt with as is that of selecting an appropriate form of the remainder condition for complement division CACM April 1971 Stein M L Munro W D division algorithm complement arithmetic complement division ones complement arithmetic twos complement arithmetic 315 40 49 511 632 CA710405 JB February 3 1978 328 PM 1965 4 2200 2200 4 2200 1718 5 2200 2200 5 2200 2200 5 2200 2200 5 2200
