Some Techniques for Using Pseudorandom Numbers in Computer Simulation An algorithm is described by which uniform pseudorandom integers may be used to construct binary numbers in which the probability that each bit in the word is a 1-bit and can assume any desired parameter value Techniques for making use of such numbers in simulation programming are described CACM July 1969 Donnelly T random numbers simulation Boolean algebra bit manipulation 519 539 CA690710 JB February 17 1978 854 AM 1794 4 1870 1870 4 1870 2122 4 1870 1674 5 1870 1870 5 1870 1870 5 1870 1870 5 1870
