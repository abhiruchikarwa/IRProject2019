An Analysis of Algorithms for the Dutch National Flag Problem Solutions to the Dutch National Flag Problem have been given by Dijkstra 1 and Meyer 3 Dijkstra starts with a simple program and arrives at an improved program by refinement Both of the algorithms given by Dijkstra are shown to have an expected number of swaps which is 23N  01 and that these values differ at most by 13 of a swap and asymptotically by 14 of a swap The algorithm of Meyer is shown to have expected swap complexity 59N CACM October 1978 McMaster C Algorithmic analysis Dutch National Flag Problem refinement structured programming 40 524 525 53 CA781006 DH January 29 1979 547 PM 3055 5 3055 3055 5 3055 3055 5 3055 3170 5 3055 3055 6 3055 3104 6 3055
