A Comparison of Hardware and Software Associative Memories in the Context of Computer Graphics The Associative Processing of Line Drawings APLD System utilizes a hardware associative memory and creates modifies deletes stores and retrieves two-dimensional line drawings consisting of poin ts lines rectangles and triangles The APLD functions were duplicated on the TX-2 computer at Ms Lincoln Laboratory under the LEAP Language and Data Structure A comparison of the hardware approach with the software simulation illustrates the advantages of the hardware associative memory in three areas 1 processing speed 2 storage requirements and 3 flexibility The major problem areas of hardware associative memory technology namely inputoutput and cost effectiveness are also addressed CACM May 1977 Stillman N J Berra P B associative memory associative processor content-addressable memory graphics information retrieval data structures software evaluation hardware evaluation parallel processing database management 371 372 373 374 434 46 622 82 CA770505 JB December 29 1977 207 AM 2719 4 2967 2967 4 2967 2151 5 2967 2967 5 2967 2967 5 2967 2967 5 2967
