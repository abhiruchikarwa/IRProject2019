A Modification of Efroymsons Technique for Stepwise Regression Analysis The computational technique conventionally used for stepwise multiple linear regression requires the storage of an n X n matrix of data When the number of variables n is large this requirement taxes the storage capacity of presently used machinery The near symmetry of the matrices involved permits a modification requiring only half the storage and computations of the conventional algorithm and this additional storage allows the analysis of problems containing more variables Alternatively it permits the analysis of problems containing the same number of variables but with all computations performed in double precision CACM August 1968 Breaux H J multiple linear regression statistical recurrence formulas correlation linear statistical models statistical computer programs curve fitting 40 440 50 55 510 513 CA680805 JB February 22 1978 1052 AM 1709 5 1709 1709 5 1709 1709 5 1709
