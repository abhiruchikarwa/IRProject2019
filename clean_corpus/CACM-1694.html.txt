An Algorithm for the Probability of the Union of a Large Number of Events An algorithm is presented which efficiently evaluates the probability for the union of n independent and not mutually exclusive events The problem is that of evaluating the sums of the products of all possible combinations of n variables in minimum time and storage space CACM September 1968 Miller G D algorithm probability optimum storage vs time compromise set union mutually exclusive events 512 55 56 CA680907 JB February 22 1978 845 AM 1694 5 1694 1694 5 1694 1694 5 1694
