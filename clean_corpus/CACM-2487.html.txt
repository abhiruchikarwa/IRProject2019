Cubic Spline solutions to Fourth-order Boundary Value Problems The cubic spline approximation to the fourth-order differential equation ypxyqxyrxytx is shown to reduce to the solution of a five-term recurrence relationship For some special cases the approximation is shown to be simply related to a finite difference representation with a local truncation error of order y720delta8 CACM June 1973 Hoskins W D cubic spline differential equations boundary value problem 513 517 CA730613 JB January 23 1978 144 PM 2487 5 2487 2487 5 2487 2487 5 2487
