A Comparison of List Schedules for Parallel Processing Systems The problem of scheduling two or more processors to minimize the execution time of a program which consists of a set of partially ordered tasks is studied Cases where task execution times are deterministic and others in which execution times are random variables are analyzed It is shown that different algorithms suggested in the literature vary significantly in execution time and that the B-schedule of Coffman and Graham is near-optimal A dynamic programming solution for the case in which execution times are random variables is presented CACM December 1974 Adam T L Chandy K M Dickson J R parallel processing precedence graphs scheduling list scheduling optimization dynamic programming 43 432 434 435 53 532 54 542 81 CA741204 JB January 16 1978 942 AM 2570 5 2570 2570 5 2570 2570 5 2570
