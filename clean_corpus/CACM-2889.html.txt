Performance of Height-Balanced Trees This paper presents the results of simulations that investigate the performance of height-balanced HBk trees It is shown that the only statistic of HB1 trees AVL trees that is a function of the size of the tree is the time to search for an item in the tree For sufficiently large trees the execution times of all procedures for maintaining HB1 trees are independent of the size of the tree In particular an average of 465 restructures are required per insertion with an average of 278 nodes revisited to restore the HB1 property an average of 214 restructures are required per deletion with an average of 191 nodes revisited to restore the HB1 property Moreoverthe execution times of procedures for maintaining HBk trees for k1 are also independent of the size of the tree except for the average number of nodes revisited on a delete operation in order to restore the HBk property on trace back The cost of maintaining HBk trees drops sharply as the allowable imbalance k increases Both analytical and experimental results that show the cost of maintaining HBk trees as a function of k are discussed CACM January 1976 Karlton P L Fuller S H Scroggs R E Kaehler E B HBk trees balanced trees AVL trees information storage and retrieval searching 37 372 374 449 539 CA760104 JB January 5 1978 1027 AM 2411 4 2889 2455 4 2889 2493 4 2889 2709 4 2889 2889 4 2889 2889 4 2889 2889 4 2889 2937 4 2889 2968 4 2889 2968 4 2889 2989 4 2889 3005 4 2889 3025 4 2889 3042 4 2889 3101 4 2889 2138 5 2889 2388 5 2889 2455 5 2889 2839 5 2889 2889 5 2889 2889 5 2889 2889 5 2889 3042 5 2889 3096 5 2889 3163 5 2889 2455 6 2889 2839 6 2889 2839 6 2889 2839 6 2889 2889 6 2889 2889 6 2889 2889 6 2889 2889 6 2889 2968 6 2889 3009 6 2889 3009 6 2889 3065 6 2889 3096 6 2889
