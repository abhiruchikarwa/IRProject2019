Use of the LRU Stack Depth Distribution for Simulation of Paging Behavior Two families of probability distributions were needed for use by a virtual memory simulation model headway between page fault distributions and working set size distributions All members of both families can be derived from the LRU stack depth distribution Simple expressions for the computation of both kinds of distributions are given Finally examples are given of both families of distributions as computed from a published stack depth distribution CACM November 1977 Turner R Strecker B virtual memory paging LRU stack working set headway between page faults computer system simulation 435 46 81 CA771102 JB December 27 1977 804 AM 2914 5 2914 2914 5 2914 2914 5 2914
