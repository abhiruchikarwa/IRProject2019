Storing a Sparse Table The problem of storing and searching large sparse tables is ubiquitous in computer science The standard technique for storing such tables is hashing but hashing has poor worst-case performance We propose a good worst-case method for storing a static table of n entries each an integer between 0 and N - 1 The method requires 0n w words of storage and allows Ologn N access time Although our method is a little complicated to use in practice our analysis shows why a simpler algorithm used for compressing LR parsing tables works so well CACM November 1979 Tarjan R Yao A Gaussian elimination parsing searching sparse matrix table compression table lookup 374 412 434 525 CA791104 DB January 23 1980 1124 AM 3041 4 3176 3126 4 3176 3176 4 3176 2905 5 3176 3176 5 3176 3176 5 3176 3176 5 3176
