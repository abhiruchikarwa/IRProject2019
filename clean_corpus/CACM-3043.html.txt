Distributed Processes A Concurrent Programming Concept A language concept for concurrent processes without common variables is introduced These processes communicate and synchronize by means of procedure calls and guarded regions This concept is proposed for real-time applications controlled by microcomputer networks with distributed storage The paper gives several examples of distributed processes and shows that they include procedures coroutines classes monitors processes semaphores buffers path expressions and inputoutput as special cases CACM November 1978 Hansen P Concurrent programming distributed processes microprocessor networks nondeterminism guarded regions programming languages process communication and scheduling sorting arrays coroutines classes monitors processes semaphores buffers path expressions inputoutput 38 42 422 432 524 CA781108 DH January 26 1979 1040 AM 2865 4 3043 2866 4 3043 2896 4 3043 2898 4 3043 2972 4 3043 2972 4 3043 3037 4 3043 3039 4 3043 3043 4 3043 3043 4 3043 3073 4 3043 3128 4 3043 3144 4 3043 2597 5 3043 2732 5 3043 3043 5 3043 3043 5 3043 3043 5 3043
