Permutation of Data Blocks in a Bubble Memory A common internal organization of bubble memories consists of a set of minor loops connected through another major loop The problem of obtaining any give n permutation of the minor loop contents in minimum time is studied in this paper A lower bound to the number of steps required buy a permutation algorithm is derived and the class of optimum algorithms is identified CACM January 1979 Bongiovanni G Luccio F Bubble memory memory loops permutation algorithm data block shift 434 530 634 CA790103 DH April 10 1979 1204 PM 3118 5 3118 3118 5 3118 3118 5 3118
