An Improved Algorithm for Decentralized Extrema-Finding in Circular Configurations of Processes This note presents an improvement to LeLanns algorithm for finding the largest or smallest of a set of uniquely numbered processes arranged in a circle in which no central controller exists and the number of processes is not known a priori This decentralized algorithm uses a technique of selective message extinction in order to achieve an average number of message passes of order n log n rather than On2 CACM May 1979 Chang E Roberts R Decentralized algorithms distributed systems operating systems 432 435 525 532 CA790502 DH June 5 1979 235 PM 3141 5 3141 3141 5 3141 3141 5 3141
