# IRProject-Spring2019
## INTRODUCTION: 

As a part of this project, we plan to build various information retrieval systems, varying in implementation by the techniques used for query enhancement and for preprocessing the corpus. We further plan to implement displaying results so that they describe the search results in a better manner. Additionally, we will evaluate these retrieval systems based on the results returned. 

### Prerequisites:
- Java - Apache Lucene runs of Java 7 or greater, Java 8 is verified to be compatible and may bring some performance improvements.
- Python - We have used [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for the project.
